# Smart AdServer / Unity â€” Integration Sample

## 1. Getting started

To get started, simply checkout this project and open it using the latest version of _Unity_ (tested on *Unity 5.4.0f3*).

This project is based on the official _Space Shooter_ tutorial available [in _Unity_ official documentation](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial). It has been modified to handle accelerometer input, thus making it playable on mobile devices.

When the project is run through the _Unity Editor_ or as any build target except _Android_ & _iOS_, the game will run properly without any ads being displayed. If the same project is run as an _Android_ or an _iOS_ target, a banner and an interstitial ad will be fetched using the embedded _Smart AdServer Display SDK_ and will be displayed to the player when he loses.
