# Smart AdServer / Unity â€” Integration Sample

## Introduction

[Smart AdServer](http://smartadserver.com) offers an ad serving SDK for both _iOS_ and _Android_ devices. However, there is no official SDK for _Unity_.

_Unity_ allows the development of custom native plugins that will be integrated to the final application depending of the targeted platform: this means that native mobile SDK can be used inside an _Unity_ project using the native plugin interface.

Since integrating a native SDK into a _Unity_ project is not easy and poorly documented, this sample will show you how to display simple banner and interstitial ads in an _Unity_ game while it is running on _iOS_ or _Android_. Using the plugins for these platforms doesn't remove the possibility to run the project on other platforms.

This sample is based on a modified version of the official _Space Shooter_ tutorial. You can find more informations about it on _Unity_'s website: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial
